//Nmap and Wireshark by { Daily Investors }
// In this test, we will run nmap scans side by side with Wireshark focusing on the "Flags"

1. First to pick the correct Wireshark setting.
2. We wil use eth0. eth0 is basically a landline/home network.
3. Ensure you pick the correct interface.
4. In this test scan, we will use "Nmaps" three-way handshake.
   sudo nmap -sT 555.555.5.555 -p22
5. To begin testing with "Wireshark". We have to set a filter for "Port 22"  
   tcp.port == 22
   //You can wittness the handshake through "Wireshark".
   Remember Knowing how to filter, is the most important!
6. Basically the attacker sends a "SYN" packet, then we get one back from that host.
   A series of transfers are taking place.
7. Now to run a "nmap" scan from the data on "Wireshark".
   sudo nmap 555.555.5.555 -p22 //Basic Scan
   Should by default run "SYN" stealth scan.
8. Now to terminate the attacker. We can send a reset flag or request.
   This can take place before the "Handshake" finishes.


//Notes
1.TCP connection scans are less efficient.
2. Full TCP scans, are more likly to log the connection!
3. Knowing and Understanding these flags, are a crucial part to Testing.
4. Remember when Testing, you could be going up against a "Blue Team".
5. With Technology today, if you dont protect yourself, you might get attacked back.
   I have frfr, and authorized. However, Wireshark can be evaded and spoofed.
   
7. Change Nmap Description of User-Agent. Do not give Yourself away.
